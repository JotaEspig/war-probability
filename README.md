# war-probability
Calculates your chances in the board game War

# Usage
To use you just need to (for example):
```python
import war
war.print_simple_attacks_statistics()
war.attack_with_against_statistics(200, 80)
```

If it's taking too much time to execute, set the variable to a lower value:
```python
war.RUNS_AMOUNT = 1000
```
